Tiny Python 2.7 Notebook
========================

This repository contains the text for the *Tiny Python 2.7 Notebook*.

Warning, this is not an introduction to Python. Rather it is a notebook
containing curated examples for Python 3 as well as the new features
found in Python 2.7. It is designed to accompany technical corporate
training offered by the author or aid those who want a quick refresher
to the Python syntax.

Errors

The author is human and will certainly make errors. You may file a bug
and it may be resolved in a future version of the book. I love feedback
and would love to hear your ideas on what is missing or could be
improved.
